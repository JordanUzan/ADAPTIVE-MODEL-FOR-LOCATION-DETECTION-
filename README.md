# ADAPTIVE-MODEL-FOR-LOCATION-DETECTION


The Project comprises an analysis of a problem, Which involves algorithms of improving the solution of the location detection 
with Machine Learning using MATLAB. It improves previous techniques, which detects the distance between the transmitter and the
receiver by measuring Inputs and outputs phase over all different frequencies. It includes having datasets of the communication 
system, building an algorithm that estimates the parameters of the system. after that, we will develop an improved algorithm, 
using the same system, in order to find the system parameters. We will compare between those algorithms and make sure that indeed 
it is an improved algorithm. We will simulate the system and analyze the output properties of the system. We will make this process 
in different frequencies and have conclusions abouttheestimation.
